# Technical Documentation — POS System

> This document explains where the ER (Mermaid) diagram lives, how to reference it from your README/other docs, and includes a direct link to the live Mermaid diagram so clients can open it with one click.

---

## 1. Files to add to your repository (optional)

* `docs/er-diagram.mmd` — optional: if you want to keep the raw mermaid source in the repo.
* `TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md` — this file (already present) linking to the live diagram.

> Note: per your request, the raw Mermaid source has been removed from this document. Use the live link below instead.

---

## 2. ER Diagram (Mermaid Live)

Open the ER diagram (Mermaid Live) using the following link:

**https://www.mermaidchart.com/app/projects/c70298c0-9143-4e2a-be33-ddf5f37be52f/diagrams/e670b369-e66a-4e90-890c-c11872abed9a/version/v0.1/edit**

```
<PASTE_YOUR_MERMAID_LIVE_LINK_HERE>
```

Replace the placeholder above with your actual mermaid.live URL. When the client clicks that link they will be taken directly to the rendered diagram where they can preview, edit, or export SVG/PNG.

### Quick example — putting the link in your README

Add a simple relative or absolute link in your README so clients can click it:

```md
[ER Diagram (Mermaid Live)](<PASTE_YOUR_MERMAID_LIVE_LINK_HERE>)
```

Or use a raw GitHub URL if you host an `er-diagram.mmd` file in the repo:

```md
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>/<branch>/docs/er-diagram.mmd
```

---

## 3. Preview & Export tips

* mermaid.live: open the URL and use the **Export** menu to download SVG or PNG.
* VS Code: if you keep an `er-diagram.mmd` file in `docs/`, use Mermaid preview extensions to render locally.
* GitHub: embedding a `mermaid` fenced block in `README.md` will render the diagram on GitHub if Mermaid is supported.

---

## 4. Need me to insert the link?

If you paste your `mermaid.live` link here, I can update this file and your README with the clickable link right now. Or I can create `docs/er-diagram.mmd` in the repo if you prefer the source stored alongside your docs.
